### About
DoRothEA is a gene set resource containing signed transcription factor (TF) - target interactions for human and mouse. The collection of a TF and its transcriptional targets is defined as regulon. DoRothEA regulons were curated and collected from different types of evidence such as literature curated resources, ChIP-seq peaks, TF binding site motifs and interactions inferred directly from gene expression. You can find more information [here](https://saezlab.github.io/dorothea/).
