# R package to access the non-academic version of DoRothEA's regulons

### Installation

```r
# install the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("saezlab/dorothea_R", ref = "non-academic")
```

### What is the difference to the academic version?
From the curated databases we removed TRED as it cannot be used
for commercial purposes.
