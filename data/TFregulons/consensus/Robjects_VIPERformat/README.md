TOP10score regulons contain the targets with the highest quatilty score possible (and n>=10) per TF. For example, for TP53 we know more than 10 targets with score A, therefore, the top scoring regulon for TP53 is composed of all its targets with A score. For BACH1, we only have a target with A score and 29 with B score, therefore the best BACH1 regulon is composed with the targets with scores equal or better than B (i.e. A and B).
