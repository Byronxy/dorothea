Description: This package contains human and mouse TF regulons.
    The human regulons were curated and collected from different types of 
    evidence such as literature curated resources, ChIP-seq peaks, TF binding 
    site motifs and interactions inferred directly from gene expression. The 
    mouse regulons were constructed by mapping the human gene symbols to their 
    orthologs in mice.
